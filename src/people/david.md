### Three things David worked on:
* [Symphony.live](https://symphony.live/), a Netflix-like streaming service for classical music lovers, offering concerts from the global top 10 orchestras to a growing base of fans across the world as a monthly subscription. Client: Symphony Media, David was Head of Product with 2 development teams building the web-, mobile- and TV apps and all the marketing funnels leading into it.
* [Elsevier Health Hubs](https://elsevier.health/en-US/home), a web app bundling evidence based best practices on how to diagnose, treat and prevent COVID19. This required collecting topical info from multiple internal data silos and representing it intuitively. Later, it evolved into a content marketing hub for multiple topics. David was Product Manager for the project.
* [The Lancet](), 

> David is an amazing captain. The way he navigates digital transformation projects through dangerous waters is off this planet. The rigor, force and expertise he brings in, helped me and many client teams to get the impossible done. He has an exquisite nose for highly talented people that help push any project beyond expectations and result. His critical thinking and pirate attitude makes working with David an incredible delight. I would love to be on his team on any project because it certainly is going to be challenging but it's gonna be great fun at the same time. Sign me up, skipper.â€”Jonne Kuyt, Director of design and innovation
