> David is an amazing captain. The way he navigates digital transformation projects through dangerous waters is off this planet. The rigor, force and expertise he brings in, helped me and many client teams to get the impossible done. He has an exquisite nose for highly talented people that help push any project beyond expectations and result. His critical thinking and pirate attitude makes working with David an incredible delight. I would love to be on his team on any project because it certainly is going to be challenging but it's gonna be great fun at the same time. Sign me up, skipper.â€”Jonne Kuyt, Director of design and innovation
