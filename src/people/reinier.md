As a UX Designer by training and Product Manager by experience, Reinier comes preloaded with strong analytical skills, a toolbox full of design methods and a lot of real-world experience. Basically, he’s the embodiment of the user voice in any development process: determined to make stuff as simple and accessible as possible. He absorbs the details of goals and challenges as a sponge, figuring out why they exist, identifying which ones should be prioritized and determining how to solve them with the team. This way, he ensures the most value for customers, clients, future generations, our climate, you name it.
